      "NFLUENCER is a web-based marketplace where users can create, buy, sell, and exchange NFTs for services or cash. The platform makes it simple for influencers, freelancers, and other creative professionals to offer gigs and manage orders. It features an NFT marketplace integrated with smart contracts on the Ethereum network, ensuring secure and transparent transactions. Users can easily list their services, connect with buyers, and even exchange NFTs as rewards. The system also includes order management and a payment system that brings everything together on one convenient website.",

The idea was to mix traditional gig services with a cool NFT twist. The platform needed to let users create service packages, handle payments securely, and offer a smooth, easy-to-use experience for both sellers and buyers.",

    description: "Developed a transport booking platform for Bueno Express Transport. The system handles trip and bus bookings, luggage transport, and door-to-door pickups and dropoffs. It serves several cities including BRONX, MANHATTAN, Newburgh, and more. The platform features both user and admin dashboards, with functionalities like email bookings, captcha verifications, and multiple payment methods. It was first built using PHP, MySQL, Apache, HTML, and JavaScript, then later redesigned with the MERN stack and deployed on AWS.",
    challenge: "The client needed a reliable and scalable system to manage different types of transport bookings. They required a solution that could handle diverse services from trip bookings to package delivery, while also managing bus schedules, routes, and cities. Integration with tools like Google Sheets for booking data and support for multiple payment methods added to the complexity.",
    approach: "I started by building a basic system using traditional web technologies. Over time, I redesigned the platform using the MERN stack to improve performance and scalability. I implemented user, admin, and support dashboards to manage bookings and operations efficiently. The system now supports various payment methods like Stripe, PayPal, and cards, along with robust verification steps such as email and captcha.",
